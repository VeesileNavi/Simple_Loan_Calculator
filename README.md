# Simple Loan Calculator
This is a simple loan calculator, writen on Kotlin. Contains month payment and overpayment calculation. Clean code, so I writed it when I was drunk af;)
So, that app have just one screen with sliders (not convenient, bu who cares?). UI developed with simple principes of design. Dark/Light mode included and depends on system colorscheme.
